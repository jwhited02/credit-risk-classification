This is my Module 20 Challenge - Credit Risk Classification
#
For this challenge, I was tasked with using various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. To do this, I: split the data into training and testing sets, created a logistic regression model with the original data, and wrote a credit risk analysis report. 
#
Overall, this challenge went pretty smoothly for me just by referring to the lectures and in-class activities. The more comprehensive run-down of what I did can be found in the 'report.md' file in the main directory, and the analysis can be found in the 'credit_risk_classification.ipynb' file also located in the main directory. The data can be found in the 'Resources' folder.

Thank you for taking the time to grade my assignment!
